act1_scene6_a3debdfa	narration	Bapat, and Donatello, are talking loud, and fast. Everybody else listens, scolds, or nod in agreement with them as statements go.

act1_scene7_cd81639d		So, something happened indeed.	game/scripts/act1.rpy	240
act1_scene7_36ab1206		I need to know it before I decide what to do with all this fuss.	game/scripts/act1.rpy	242
act1_scene7_1f0b78cf		Bapat, I can’t follow whatever it is you’re doing without being aware of the background.	game/scripts/act1.rpy	244

act1_scene8_c4a22240		I want you to tell me what happened yesterday.	game/scripts/act1.rpy	274
act1_scene8_a6775b19	donatello	Nothing, why do you bother?	game/scripts/act1.rpy	276
act1_scene8_db28b693		I bother because I’m the HR Manager of this company, Donatello, not you,	game/scripts/act1.rpy	278
act1_scene8_ad279397		and you called for a public meeting the very same day I find Priyanka in my office, and didn’t even bother to invite her to this meeting.	game/scripts/act1.rpy	280
act1_scene8_134d833e	donatello	‘This woman is really a problem, you know, Abhay.	game/scripts/act1.rpy	283
act1_scene8_70906e29		Well at least she doesn’t raise a ruckus like you and Bapat did…	game/scripts/act1.rpy	285
act1_scene8_2a744273		Now kindly tell me what happened.	game/scripts/act1.rpy	287

act1_scene8_4ef00fe3	donatello	and Bapat, well, he’s just a man, Abhay.	game/scripts/act1.rpy	291
act1_scene8_b109ab89	donatello	He made noises, and motions, and maybe I made a couple of jokes, and felt her a bit, and she started to cry, and become angry as if WE were the problem, not her, and-	game/scripts/act1.rpy	293
act1_scene8_074561d2		So you thought that you both could be in trouble, hence the ruckus you raise this morning.	game/scripts/act1.rpy	295
act1_scene8_89d6199c	donatello	I only think about the well-being of the company, Abhay,	game/scripts/act1.rpy	297
act1_scene8_f07520f6	donatello	customers come in here sometimes, what impression do we give to them by having Priyanka dressed up like this?	game/scripts/act1.rpy	299
act1_scene8_f0a623c5	donatello	This isn’t a massage parlor, and what if the others, like Manali, start to copy her?	game/scripts/act1.rpy	301
act1_scene8_e90597f8	donatello	Men have drives, Abhay, she’s asking for it,	game/scripts/act1.rpy	303

act1_scene9_22759a01	bapat	Are you going to do something about it, Abhay?	game/scripts/act1.rpy	320
act1_scene10_e29e6ca6	narration	You’ve heard their explanations, and have gathered enough information to take a decision, and solve this problem now.	game/scripts/act1.rpy	335
act1_scene10_eb90856e	narration	You could draft a dress code for all the employees of the office, so that Priyanka wouldn’t feel targeted, and that good work conditions can be maintained for everyone.	game/scripts/act1.rpy	337
act1_scene10_94ee8c66	narration	You could also take even less risks by calling for a public poll in the meeting room, so that everybody will have the opportunity to give one’s advice, and if anything goes wrong, you won’t be held responsible for it.	game/scripts/act1.rpy	339
act1_scene10_783b94f4	narration	Or maybe you think that sometimes, a HR Manager has to take difficult decisions, and since Priyanka is the root of this trouble, you will issue her a warning to have her start dressing more appropriately, after all, she’s the only troublesome one as nobody ever complains about the other women.	game/scripts/act1.rpy	341
act1_scene11_f04601f1	narration	You draft a dress code forbidding short dresses, heels, and skirts, and requesting decency from the employees	game/scripts/act1.rpy	355

act1_scene12_a406cb39	narration	You’ve decided to call for a public poll, and gather everyone once again in the meeting room.	game/scripts/act1.rpy	364

act1_scene12_9b04b973	bapat	Why does she have to dress like this? This isn’t a party!	game/scripts/act1.rpy	370
act1_scene12_8b74e435	priyanka	And how do I dress exactly, Bapat, do tell me? Is this because I’m not wrapped head to toe in a sari?	game/scripts/act1.rpy	374
act1_scene12_ed3398d9	donatello	It’s either sari, or panties with you.	game/scripts/act1.rpy	378
act1_scene12_dc464097	narration	The other women blush, and laugh with him.	game/scripts/act1.rpy	380

act1_scene12_e111aa50	narration	With this, Priyanka leaves the meeting room in tears while the others whistle, and laugh. {p} Since the public meeting has turned into a nightmare, and added to Priyanka’s shaming, you regret this idea, but it’s a little too late.	game/scripts/act1.rpy	412
act1_scene13_1d70f0e2	narration	Since Priyanka is the only one causing trouble, you see no need to bother everyone with a dress code, or a public poll.	game/scripts/act1.rpy	420
act1_scene13_b5345877	narration	After all, Bapat, and Donatello have both explained the situation to you, and though you dislike doing it, you decide to issue Priyanka a warning.{p} It’s not your problem whether she accepts it peacefully or not, she has to be professional. Since the new CEO is said to be tough, this could be your chance to prove yourself worthwhile, and who knows, to be promoted.	game/scripts/act1.rpy	422
act1_scene14_5d25cac4	narration	Following your decision, and the events of the day, Priyanka gives you her resignation letter the next morning.{p=1} Bapat and Donatello gloat in the open space, and start making jokes about Manali, the Secretary, as well.{p=1} Given the terms of her contract, Priyanka has to stay for a month, now wearing an oversized sweater, and trousers, and will be there when the new CEO comes.{p=1} Let’s hope you made the right choice.	game/scripts/act1.rpy	430
act1_scene15_2b2c8d36	narration	You unpack your lunch box in the canteen. It’s a most welcomed time of the day as everybody blows off some steam, and engage in small talk.	game/scripts/act1.rpy	444

act1_scene15_5ffe6a01	narration	The conversation then trails off on the subject of the new CEO.{p=1} M. BAJU, the former, wasn’t proactive, to put it mildly, but he maintained a peaceful if a bit droning work environment.{p=1} . We are creatures of habit, and don’t like to be shaken off them, and BAJU was our habit of a CEO, aloof, quiet, almost jaded.{p=1} You all got used to this. That was relaxing in a way.{p=1} Now that he’s gone, people are excited, and the bad stuff surfaces in this ungoverned space.	game/scripts/act1.rpy	482
act1_scene15_4ef53e29	narration	This is usually where you fall back on M. GOPINATH, the Administrative Director, but he’s taken his annual leave, and has left you alone to deal with everything.	game/scripts/act1.rpy	488

act1_scene31_679f8d0a	narration	Instead of helping her, exposing Priyanka’s former relationship with Bapat’s son has fuelled the attacks against her. {p=1} For most people at the office, this is a proof that Bapat is a bad person, but also that Priyanka has no decency, and that Bapat was right in shaming her.	game/scripts/act1.rpy	843
act1_scene31_5c447ac5	narration	A week later, Priyanka gives you her resignation letter. {p=1} Given the terms of her contract, she has to stay for a month, now wearing an oversized sweater, and trousers, not talking to anyone anymore.	game/scripts/act1.rpy	846

act1_scene34_c2690a95	narration	You copy it into the policy documents, and send it to all, now backed by the full force of the international Headquarters!

act2_scene16_1ec0299e	email	rajkumarrajkumarltd@gmail.com To: abhay.chandrakant@cryptaloo.in Re: Promotion and Discrimination Dear M. Chandrakant, If your Mrs. Shaikh Giti can prove the alleged discrimination she suffers mutatis mutandis, the situation could lead to a case in court indeed, and involve liabilities, and damages as per the accessory of the main article to be continued habeas corpus. In all actuality (Ibid.), discrimination is very difficult to prove as she would require either written proofs, several witnesses, or written proof of a constant pattern from the company’s side to support her claim. Since she will find deprived of these proofs, it is most probable that she will not escalate as fees will discourage her from doing so as well.

Chandrakant, So far, all that we know is that Mrs. Shaikh Giti is suing the company on the basis of the Denial of Equal Opportunity. She says that she has collected proofs, but we have not seen these proofs as yet, and we might be in a position to challenge them if they seem weak. Only then will I know what our chances to win the trial are, and if they seem low, to open negotiations with her. If, from your position you can gather already that she will have a decent amount of solid proof, I advise you to promote her so that you can avoid paying for the damages she requests. If this isn’t the case, I advise you to proceed so that we can see what she has, and take appropriate action. Yours truly, M. Rajkumar Rajkumar & Rajkumar Ltd.	game/scripts/act2.rpy	726

Hence and hereby, he cannot be protected against discrimination where the fact discriminated hitherto would fall under penal Law, and Nemo auditur propriam turpitudinem allegans would apply so that his arguing on the basis of his homosexuality would ipso facto disqualify him from the protections the Law normally applies for discrimination.

Chandrakant, Technically, your colleague is right, the Indian Penal Code only forbids the sexual intercourse de jure, not the fact of declaring oneself homosexual, which would be doli incapax, but we all know that there cannot be one without the other. Further, it is not because a Law hasn’t been applied that it is invalid, a vote must first happen to change, or cancel the Law accordingly so that you would always take a risk for the future of the company by drafting, and implementing this policy, which I don’t recommend.

act3_scene27_b96819ec	narration	There’s a lot more in this document, but you prefer to take one step at a time. You copy the international policy into the branch’s policy, and send it off to the whole comapny by email. Later, you forward this email to the new CEO.	game/scripts/act3.rpy	1115

Since the matter entails subjects of philosophical, as well as spiritual importance, I kindly urge you to ask to the spiritual authorities of your convenience for the rule of the Law falters in front of such highness.

closure_9fbbd7f3	ashwini	I am very happy to see you all gathered here today, as CRYPTALOO India is entering a new phase with the full support and guidance of our International Headquarters.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	29
closure_2f8a3f7a	ashwini	Having worked here for many years, you have paved the ground for CRYPTALOO's future successes, and will play an important role in the developments to come.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	31
closure_c2d7fc6f	ashwini	For this, I want to thank you all.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	33
closure_2f7c3788	narration	She pauses. Everybody applauses. You wonder what's coming next.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	35
closure_869da3fc	ashwini	I am here to take CRYPTALOO India to the next level with the planned extension of four offices around the country, and to help CRYPTALOO India to enter the global market, and culture.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	37
closure_67fcc091	ashwini	I have followed the recent developments of the past weeks, and I must say that as far as global culture is concerned, I have been surprised!	game/scripts/closure.rpy	39
closure_2e52e21c	ashwini	I was saddened to learn that a woman could be shamed in your office without any reaction from its head management.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	42
closure_ee8eb9b1	ashwini	By laying the fault on Priyanka, or letting it happen, you have actually taken sides with the harassers against the victim.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	44
closure_94688bf0	ashwini	This is not how the culture can change, and this casts a bad light on the company in general.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	46
closure_49326b0d	narration	Ashwini looks at you straight in the eyes, and speaks.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	48
closure_f6461f14	ashwini	M. Chandrakant, I know that you did what you thought was right, but you're not the company's psychologist.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	50
closure_b224325e	ashwini	And trying to meddle with the employee’s private life as you did when Priyanka was having troubles didn't help to solve the situation{w=0.25}, to say the least.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	52
closure_5ceb7be1	ashwini	We can't confuse private and professional life, or let people take advantage of private informations.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	54
closure_bc2403cd	narration	She looks at Bapat sideways, and continues.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	56
closure_19520277	ashwini	In that case, you should have reported the situation, ensured Priyanka of your support, and taken a firm action to stop the shaming she was facing.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	58
closure_9b89d93c	ashwini	I must say I'm impressed, M. Chandrakant.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	60
closure_7a86386a	ashwini	Not only did you resolve the situation caused by Priyanka's shaming by implementing a dress code that can’t be disputed since it applies to all of CRYPTALOO’s branches,	game/scripts/closure.rpy	62
closure_79f42e2f	ashwini	But you have also laid the ground for future policies towards inclusiveness, and tolerance masterfully!	game/scripts/closure.rpy	64
closure_6ebd69b9		<Error: Act 1 Ending Missing>	game/scripts/closure.rpy	66
closure_a4715bf9	ashwini	On another subject, I am happy to see that Giti has been promoted.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	69
closure_76a65f0b	ashwini	It was about time Madam Shaikh was rewarded for her efforts, and takes on more responsibilities with us.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	71
closure_5cedecaf	ashwini	Too long have we seen people thriving on titles, and positions, while the groundwork was done by someone else, this needs to change.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	73
closure_dd846281	ashwini	Unfortunately, we now have a lawsuit on our hands because you didn't hear Madam Shaikh's legitimate request out, M. Chandrakant.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	75
closure_ba4f0729	ashwini	If I'm not mistaken, she was leading the Transportation Department in addition to her job, and took many responsibilities that weren't her own.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	77
closure_238adba4	ashwini	Why would you ignore her request for a promotion, was it undeserved?	game/scripts/closure.rpy	79
closure_719b7b26		I-I{w=0.25}, err-{w=0.25}, I wasn't,{w=0.25} I don't know.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	81
closure_fe08da30	ashwini	Yes, I know you don't know, M. Chandrakant, because you didn't consider her situation, or her value for the company, and now I must defuse this trial.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	83
closure_c3dbfc71		<Error: Act 2 Ending Missing>	game/scripts/closure.rpy	85
closure_51f6a9fe	ashwini	This being said, I have been informed of an employee of this company, who had to face a difficult situation because of his sexual orientation.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	88
closure_c3562f12	ashwini	While I support and endorse your views on inclusiveness on this matter, M. Chandrakant, the way you've dealt with the employees' reactions to this situation was rather harsh, even repressive.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	90
closure_b9acb96e	ashwini	Since this is a delicate matter, you should have tried to listen more, and gradually bring the employees over to your views instead of punishing them, and reinforcing their prejudices.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	92
closure_e4446a5b	ashwini	That wasn't very skillful, M. Chandrakant, and I withdraw the collective warning you have issued at that time.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	94
closure_51f6a9fe_1	ashwini	This being said, I have been informed of an employee of this company, who had to face a difficult situation because of his sexual orientation.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	96
closure_f5c29622	ashwini	I am well aware that this was a delicate situation, but the least you could have done, M. Chandrakant, was to provide him with your support and understanding instead of howling with the wolves.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	98
closure_23244955	ashwini	I am truly disappointed.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	100
closure_f0bddb08	ashwini	This being said, I have been informed of the situation of an employee of this company, who had to face a difficult situation because of his sexual orientation.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	102
closure_1cba118b	ashwini	You have surprised me, M. Chandrakant, I must say, when you decided to apply the international policy to our Indian branch.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	104
closure_06f54203	ashwini	It wasn't your call to establish a new policy all by yourself though I understand you did it to defuse a potentially disruptive situation.{w=0.25} I appreciate your efforts.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	106
closure_c8baa4f2	ashwini	I still need time to consider how to apply the international policy to our branch,	game/scripts/closure.rpy	108
closure_200c5893	ashwini	But in the meantime I assure all of you that no employee will be discriminated against in this company for his sexual orientation.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	110
closure_1b76bd7c		<Error: Act 3 Ending Missing>	game/scripts/closure.rpy	112
closure_7261e9dc	ashwini	Last but not least, I must remind you, M. Chandrakant, that India is a secular country!	game/scripts/closure.rpy	115
closure_474b3089	ashwini	How on Earth did you come to the conclusion that you could fire an employee because she wouldn't want to participate to a religious ceremony?	game/scripts/closure.rpy	117
closure_b19febe7	ashwini	This is not a temple, this is a corporate office!	game/scripts/closure.rpy	119
closure_53c77488	ashwini	An individual's religion shouldn't matter at the office, and if we believe in our Constitution, it shouldn't even matter anywhere in India!	game/scripts/closure.rpy	121
closure_41b2b66e	ashwini	Last but not least, I wonder why you didn't accept to give your employees a room for their prayers, M. Chandrakant?	game/scripts/closure.rpy	123
closure_30e95fa6	ashwini	Is that because you think that religion should have no say at all in the company?	game/scripts/closure.rpy	125
closure_08e0a16d	ashwini	If this is the case, then why is the shrine still in the entrance?	game/scripts/closure.rpy	127
closure_d468542e	ashwini	It's either all or none, M. Chandrakant, we can't pick and choose, and force our individual beliefs on others.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	129
closure_0d57eae9	ashwini	Last but not least, I must say that I approve your giving the employees a space for their prayers, M. Chandrakant.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	131
closure_2b9a7fdb	ashwini	We all work in the same company, but are different people, and we need to welcome everyone as they are regardless of their faith.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	133
closure_05285383		<Error: Act 4 Ending Missing>	game/scripts/closure.rpy	135
closure_ending_3e1ddba2	ashwini	As you all can see, our small family is changing, and expanding.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	142
closure_ending_c27f093f	ashwini	This means that there will be new opportunities for all of you, and new ways of working together.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	144
closure_ending_ec884346	ashwini	Some of you will feel pushed, and will resent the changes, while others will embrace them.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	146
closure_ending_32de0581	ashwini	I want to let you know that I will always be available to listen to you, to help, and to support you.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	148
closure_ending_cbc50334	ashwini	In order to prove these words, I am not taking any action today except for one.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	150
closure_ending_085e5737	ashwini	Change is a process, it takes time and understanding, and I will give you plenty of those so that you can adjust and determine by yourself how to cope with these changes and new work environment.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	152
closure_ending_2422e7a5	narration	You raise your hand.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	154
closure_ending_1159d4cc		Madam, you said you would take one action, which is it?	game/scripts/closure.rpy	156
closure_ending_d802c9ca	ashwini	Oh yes, that.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	158
closure_ending_35c2cb55	ashwini	M. Gopinath, can you step forward please?	game/scripts/closure.rpy	160
closure_ending_0773f4f6	narration	M. Gopinath seems surprised, and moves forward.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	162
closure_ending_9f58396b	ashwini	Where were you all this time? {w=0.25}Why didn't you answer your emails?	game/scripts/closure.rpy	164
closure_ending_16fe9922	ashwini	You know that you were supposed to be back last week, didn't you?	game/scripts/closure.rpy	166
closure_ending_e9a72567	narration	M. Gopinath blushes, and growls something that you can't hear.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	168
closure_ending_e21d33fb	ashwini	You are fired, M. Gopinath.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	170

closure_ending_2642e5b3	thinking	Kind words, and a display of power, times are going to be interesting.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	176
closure_ending_b53db085	ashwini	M. Chandrakant, I have a few words for you as well.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	178
closure_bad_ending_7b8a019a	ashwini	You have managed to achieve the feat of getting the company sued, an employee quitting, and to change dramatically the atmosphere for the worst in just one week.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	190
closure_bad_ending_578dadfc	ashwini	I must say I didn’t think it was possible to be lacking empathy to this extent.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	192
closure_bad_ending_2cb15a0e	ashwini	With M. Gopinath away, you had an opportunity to show what you were capable of, and, well, you did.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	194
closure_bad_ending_37a2f5c2	thinking	Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. I got it all wrong!	game/scripts/closure.rpy	196
closure_bad_ending_5def0da4	narration	You thought that you would be congratulated for your hard but necessary decisions, and it sure looks like you’re not going to be.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	198
closure_bad_ending_5d47d62e	ashwini	I will try to connect with Giti, and to offer her to become our new Human Resources Manager.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	200
closure_bad_ending_18b27029	ashwini	It’s been a long time she should have been promoted.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	202

closure_bad_ending_4b79aca7	ashwini	If you accept, you can be her assistant, M. Chandrakant{w=0.25}, maybe you’ll learn from her.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	206
closure_bad_ending_7b170b4e	ashwini	If it doesn’t suit you, you’re free to resign.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	208

closure_good_ending_9acf2df0	ashwini	With M. Gopinath away, and myself still abroad, the fate of the whole Indian branch was lying upon your shoulders, M. Chandrakant.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	218
closure_good_ending_8b3c22bd	ashwini	Weaker, less resolute men would have left the situations to fester, and waited for my coming, but this is not what you did.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	220
closure_good_ending_da718186	ashwini	Instead, you took upon you to solve everything as you could, listened to everyone, and tried to find the most inclusive solutions with an open mind.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	222
closure_good_ending_bbecc9d4	narration	You blush.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	224
closure_good_ending_176de36d		T-That's only-	game/scripts/closure.rpy	226
closure_good_ending_d7144d05	ashwini	I am very impressed, and happy to see such qualities of both management, and empathy, in you.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	228

closure_good_ending_d6c65761	narration	You feel a bit tipsy, and a bit proud. Just a week ago, you were reaching the office with a pang of anxiety, knowing that you would be the one in charge, and now it seems that you’ve been successful all the way.	game/scripts/closure.rpy	232
